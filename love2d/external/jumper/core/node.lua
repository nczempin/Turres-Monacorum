--- <strong>The <code>node</code> class</strong>.
-- The `node` class represents a cell on a collision map. Basically, for each single cell
-- in the collision map passed-in upon initialization, a `node` object would be generated
-- and then stored within the `grid` object.
--
-- In the following implementation, nodes can be compared using the `<` operator. The comparison is
-- made on the basis of their `f` cost. From a processed node, the `pathfinder` would expand the search 
-- to the next neighbouring node having the lowest `f` cost. This comparison is internally used within the
-- *open list* `heap` to quickly sort all nodes queued inside the heap.
